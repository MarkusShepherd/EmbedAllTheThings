# EmbedAllTheThings
Slides and suplemental notebooks for my PyData LA 2019 talk titled "Embed all the things"

If you'd like to see the talk that goes along with these notebooks it can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtVR_ZnXLu4&list=PLGVZCDnMOq0pHVE3SB0ecki__VMncQPKo&index=41&t=0s).

The data in this notebook can be downloaded from that Kaggle webpage at: https://www.kaggle.com/rdoume/beerreviews It requires Kaggle login so the download can not be included in the notebooks.

A more recent and somewhat larger beer review dataset can be found on the kaggle site here:  https://www.kaggle.com/ehallmar/beers-breweries-and-beer-reviews.  It might be a good and fun excercise to modify the notebooks in this repository to analyse this data and compare the results.
